A Streamlit web application that calculates lunar stations based on the user's location and time preferences. This program tracks the Moon's movement through the ecliptic pathway of stars in real-time.

## Features

- Calculates precise starting times for lunar stations based on user location
- Supports both Northern and Southern hemispheres
- Provides ecliptic longitude and latitude calculations
- Includes detailed star descriptions for each lunar station
- Outputs in both CSV and ICS (calendar) formats
- Automatic timezone and DST handling
- Interactive preview of results
- Up to 31 days of calculations (1 month maximum)
- 1-minute precision to ensure no lunar station transitions are missed
- Sequential validation to verify complete lunar station coverage
- Memory-optimized chunked processing for reliable performance
